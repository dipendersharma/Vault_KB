If required, you can also connect to orgs using username/password connections.</p><h2>Types of Authentications- OAuth vs Basic (Standard)</h2><p><strong>Basic Authentication:</strong> If an app asks the user to enter their Salesforce credentials <em>into the app itself</em> and then authenticates to Salesforce with no further action on the part of the user, that app is performing a SOAP login (<em>not</em> OAuth), and is storing the user's raw credentials. This is a very bad practice for a variety of reasons, although security is at the top of the list.</p><p><strong>OAuth:</strong> If an app <em>redirects</em> the user to the standard Salesforce login window, where the user authenticates, then (on the first login) approves the app to use their Salesforce credentials and is finally redirected back to the app, that's OAuth. The app is storing a token, not the user's credentials.</p><h3>Connecting to Salesforce Org via OAuth</h3><ol><li>In your browser, navigate to: <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;liberation mono&quot;, &quot;courier new&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: inherit; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin: 0px; padding: 0.2em 0.4em; word-break: normal; background: rgba(0, 27, 45, 0.05); border-radius: 10px;">https://{my-organization}.autorabit.com</code></li><li>Enter your login credentials.<img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/image-1644761046026.png" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable"></li><li>Click <strong>Login</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>(<img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/image-1645029091715.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable">) icon to access the global connection panel. <img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/image-1645029156450.png" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable"></li><li>Click <strong>Connections</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>SF Environments</strong>.

The purpose of the token is to improve the security between Salesforce users and Salesforce.com in the case of a compromised account. It ensures, among other things, that if a user’s account credentials are compromised, a third party wouldn’t be able to access Salesforce.</p><h3>Losing the security token</h3><p>If you can’t remember your security token and have deleted the email containing the token, the only way to retrieve it is by resetting the token. Salesforce does not provide an option to view your token within the web application; the only option available is to reset it.</p><h3>Getting the Security Token for Your Salesforce Account</h3><p>When you create a Salesforce account, Salesforce sends an email message from support@salesforce.com with the subject:&nbsp;salesforce.com security token confirmation to the email address associated with the account. This email message contains the Security Token for the account and is the only place where you can find the Security Token value. When you change the account password, the security token is also regenerated (so the previous one expires) and a similar email is sent.</p><p>To get the security token for your Salesforce account In the mailbox for the email address associated with the Salesforce account, look for the latest email message received from support@salesforce.com with the subject: salesforce.com security token confirmation.&nbsp;</p><p>If you cannot find the latest email with the security token, reset the security token:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Log in to Salesforce using the Salesforce account.</li><li>In the User Menu, select <strong>Setup</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>In the menu on the left, under <strong>Personal Setup</strong>, expand <strong>My Personal Information</strong>, and then click <strong>Reset My Security Token</strong>. Follow onscreen instructions.&nbsp;</li><li>A new email message will be sent.&nbsp;</li><li>Open the message, and then copy the <strong>Security Token value</strong>.</li></ol><section class="infoBox"><div class="title">Important Note:</div><div class="content">It’s recommended that you save this email in a secure location so that you don’t have to reset your security token every time you need it.</div></section>
